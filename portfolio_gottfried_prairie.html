      <p class="project-overview">
        The <a href="http://gottfriedprairiearboretum.org/" target="_blank">Gottfried Prairie and Arboretum</a> is a nature preservation and restoration project in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. I wanted to give them new, more modern-feeling branding. I chose the word “connections” as my organizing concept, focusing on the connections between the plants, animals, and people that inhabit the space.

          The logo for this project was a real challenge. I went through many iterations in Illustrator before settling on something that felt right for the brand and also functioned well in a variety of contexts.

        <p>To emphasize the concept “Connections,” I used this paper cutout visual treatment in several places for the branding. The nature photography with the displaced-but-nearby visual effect evokes the feeling that something is out of place, but not irrevocably so.</p>

          Working primarily in Photoshop, I designed a refresh for the Gottfried website. I wanted to make something attractive and energetic that surfaced all the information potential visitors might want right on a single page.

          In InDesign, I created a simplified brand spec sheet to guide further designs, such as merchandise, signage, posters, and additional website pages. Crucially, I created this spec <strong>after</strong> getting the basics of the website together, extracting the standards from holistic work rather than creating building blocks before attempting to assemble them.
