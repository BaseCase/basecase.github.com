        Designs for a mobile app called “Big Ideas,” for Big Brothers Big Sisters. It’s a crowdsourced directory of location-specific activity ideas for mentors (“bigs” in the vocabulary of BBBS) to do with their mentees (“littles”). Users can search for activity ideas in their area, upload their own ideas, and review activities they try.

          This project needed to fit into existing brand standards. I didn’t have a spec to work from, so I used assets found on the client website as references to get as close as possible in the app design.
